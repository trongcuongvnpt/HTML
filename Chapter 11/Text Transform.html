<p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.
<h2>Breed History</h2>
The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to seach for wounded soldier
because of its fine sense of hearing. Briads were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the
population of briads is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Fefferson and Lafayyette all owned Briads</p>
