<p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or Berger de Brie[b] is a French breed of large shepherd dog,
    traditionally used both for herding sheep and to defend them. It was first shown at the first Paris dog show, in 1863;
    the first Briard to be registered in the Livre des Origines Françaises, the national stud-book, was Sans Gêne in 1885.
    [3] It was in the past also known as the Chien de Berger français de Plaine.</p>
